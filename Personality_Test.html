                        Our individual personalities determine one of the most basic factors of our everyday life- communication. 
                        We communicate with people even when we don’t realize it. For example, a simple smile when you walk past someone 
                        in the grocery store, a wave to a neighbor, or crossing your arms when someone is talking to you can say a lot
                        with just a simple gesture. Interpersonal communication is both verbal and nonverbal and can directly affect how someone
                        else responds to you. A fun and easy way to find out your personality style is by taking a simple online quiz with various
                        statements to which you agree or disagree with <a href="www.16personalitles.com">HERE </a>. I choose to take the personality quiz for my
                        Interpersonal Communication class, and my results determined that I have an Advocate personality. Knowing and understanding
                        your personality type is the key to mastering your interpersonal communications and being able to tailor your communication
                        to your audience. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            While taking my personality quiz I realized that personality tests are not as easy as one might believe. While we as people 
                            like to believe the world is seen in black and white, right or wrong, the gray area plays a big role when it comes down to our 
                            personal traits. While taking the personality quiz, there were a few statements where I struggled to side with a strong agreement 
                            or disagreement due to very little context being revealed to me. This leading to me making a decision to be one or the other based 
                            on what I assumed was being described. While this is just a quiz, often in life, we tend to find what is described as a gray area. As 
                            we grow as people, the way we approach situations and the views we have of situations can change and adapt to our environments. Can we have 
                            more than one determined personality? 
                        </p>

                        <h2>Advocates</h2>
    
                        <p>
                        “Advocates have an inborn sense of idealism and morality, but what sets them apart is 
                        that they are not ideal dreamer”. This statement is accurate 
                        for my personality because this is one of my biggest strengths. While strong in my morals 
                        and personal standards, I am open to seeing both sides of the fence in my relationships. I will 
                        defend my stance on things and explain as to why I think the way that I do without pressuring others 
                        to feel the same way that I do, but rather see the good and bad in the situation at hand. Having the 
                        mental tools to be able to take a stand and advocate for ideas and morals is a major strength not only in my 
                        personal life but in my professional life too. In addition, another core strength of the advocate is 
                        being inspiring and convincing. “Speaking in human terms, not technical, Advocates have a fluid inspirational 
                        writing style that appeals to the inter idealist and their audience”. Advocates can 
                        even be astonishingly good orators, speaking in warmth and passion. 
                        </p>

                            For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in 
                            him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into 
                            the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be 
                            saved through him.

                        <p>
                        “As parents, Advocates will tend to look at their relationships with their children as opportunities 
                        to learn and grow with someone they care about. Advocates want to raise children who are ethical, creative, and kind”. 
                        I relate to these statements in my personal parenting methods. Having had a child at a young age, I have utilized the opportunity 
                        to grow and learn with my child. One of my main focuses in parenting is to teach my child how to be kind to himself and others. 
                        “Advocates strive to make sure that their children grow up with a firm understanding of the difference between right and wrong”. 
                        Growing up in a culture where learning right from wrong was the heart of our morals, it is important to me as a parent to do the same with my child.

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    
                        <p>
                        In conclusion, my overall take on this quiz is that it somewhat explained certain specific reasons as to why I 
                        make certain decisions in my life. I was able to explore generalized strength and weakness in more detail and understand 
                        how it affects my interpersonal communication with other people. However, the quiz itself did not contain enough context to 
                        individualize its results. 
                        </p>

                        Although on a broad spectrum I might fall into the category of an Advocate, I feel as if some of 
                        the results did not pertain to my personality as a whole. Understanding your personality is the key to mastering your interpersonal 
                        communications and being able to tailor your communication to your audience. I believe that the results of this quiz only provide 
                        you with general descriptions and characteristics of yourself based on the answers you provide at a specific time and that in itself 
                        is subjected to change as you grow.
